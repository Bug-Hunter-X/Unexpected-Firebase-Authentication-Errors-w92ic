The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email or password is not properly formatted or if there's a network issue during the authentication process.  For instance, an invalid email format can lead to an `auth/invalid-email` error, while a weak password might result in an `auth/weak-password` error.  Network problems can manifest as generic connection errors.
